# Logic GPU Accelerated Particles

Follows the bevy compute shader tutorial at [LogicProjects on Youtube](https://youtu.be/_uKWIYEGBjs).

This is a basic implementation of a gpu based particle system.  This is not intended for production use and will expand in the future.

I'm still early in learning graphics programming and these Bevy systems so this is a refrence based on my current knowledge.  

Some things may be suboptimal, not work in wasm, or have other unforseen problems, but it shows how to use compute shaders in bevy which is the intended educational value.

# Usage

```
cargo run
```
